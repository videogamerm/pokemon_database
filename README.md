# pokemon_database
I used this tutorial
https://pythonprogramming.net/sqlite-part-2-dynamically-inserting-database-timestamps/ and https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/09-working-with-sql/index.html
and modified the code to make this project
## Why I made this
I chose to make this because I want to have my pokemon cards in a database.
## Dependencies 
The dependencies are python, and sqlite3
